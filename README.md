This project introduces an ELECTRICITY BILLING SYSTEM built with Java, linked to a Database Management System (DBMS) using JDBC. It features interfaces designed for two main users: administrators and customers. 

Administrators can add new customers, assign meter numbers, calculate electricity bills, generate bills, and access additional tools like a calculator and notepad. Customers first sign up, then they can update their information, pay bills, view statements, and use the calculator and notepad. 

The system relies on five tables: login, customer, meter_info, tax, and bill, where all relevant data is stored. By combining Java and JDBC, this project provides a simple and effective solution for managing electricity billing tasks for both administrators and customers.
